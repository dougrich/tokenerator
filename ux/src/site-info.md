## Privacy Information

### Terms

___OAuth___ is a system that, when you want to sign in, redirects you to an authority that then grants this application access to some of your information.

___OAuth Provider___ is the account provider that you signed in with: either Google or Microsoft.

A ___user id___ is a unique, random id provided by your oauth provider. It contains no information beyond which provider you signed in with.

### Tracking
I track as little as possible.

When you create a token, I make note of:
- what time it is on my servers, so browsing is sorted by most recent
- if you are signed in, your user id, so you can view your own tokens

When you batch download tokens, I do not collect any information.

### Cookies / Signing In

By default I do not use cookies.

If you sign in, I create a cookie that contains:
- your user id
- your name, as provided by your oauth provider
- your provider

I do not keep any additional account information.
