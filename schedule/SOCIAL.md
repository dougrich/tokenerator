# Facebook Content Strategies

- Post 3 times a week: M morning, W midday, F morning
- Multiple Example Tokens as filler content
- Mainline content should be more tools/tips/tricks, example usage in games, etc.
- Like other pages, but not competitors
- Be friendly all the time
- Address people by name
- Have a signature
- Post updates all the time
- Please like + share
- Videos are always better, but don't post super frequently
    - once every two weeks
- Put promotions in the cover art

Branch out twitter
- follow arcknight's followers + like content + limit to 3

Photos should be high quality
- Colder tint side
- Digital photos should be unaltered
- Logo on everything
- All artwork is mine unless stated otherwise
Google staging photos with props and stuff

# Newsletters

- Do anti-spam stuff
- Newsletters are best when sent out at ungodly hours
    - 3am
    - biweekly is most realistic, weekly is better
    - token of the week
    - theme of the month
    - new features/updates
    - longer is better
    - include discounts/offers?
    - limited availability parts
    - detailed minimal version of social media content
    - respond to customer interaction/suggestions
    - seasonal themes

In an ideal world, plan out social media content for the week - token of the week, new features/parts, etc. and then summarize in newsletter
